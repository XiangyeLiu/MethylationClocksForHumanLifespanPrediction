# Methylation Clocks for Human Lifespan Prediction
Codes for data analyses in the study "Modern humans may live triple the lifespan of archaic hominins" and several newly-trained PC-guided clocks are available here.
For .R or .py files, please refer to code to find out what form of data is needed.
Codes to train and use new PC-guided clocks are revised from codes provided by "A computational solution for bolstering reliability of epigenetic clocks, implications for clinical trials and longitudinal tracking" (https://doi.org/10.1038/s43587-022-00248-2).
